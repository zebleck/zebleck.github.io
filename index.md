Hello, my name is zebleck. My destiny has brought me to study M.Sc. Data and Computer Science at the University of Heidelberg in Germany. Before that, I did my B.Sc. Physics at the same university.

I love all things having to do with artifical intelligence, artificial life and technology in general and hope those things will be used for the betterment of everyone.

# Projects

## [Unity implementation of Lenia](https://twitter.com/zebleckAI/status/1496244990929948672)

Lenia is a ruleset for creating continuous cellular automata which produce complex behaviour and even artificial life. I am currently working on an implementation on Unity, which will be distributed on the iOS and Android app stores in the future.

## [Reinforcement Learning of Countermeasures for COVID-19 spread prevention](https://github.com/zebleck/aml_project)

In this project, we used reinforcement-learning to train an agent controlling the government supervising a COVID-19
simulation. We used the DQN algorithm for reinforcement learning to train an agent controlling a hypothetical government to prevent the spread of the COVID-19
infecton.

Done as part of the course *Advanced Machine Learning*.

## [GUI: Th/U-Dating of Speleothems and Corals](https://github.com/zebleck/BachelorGUI)

Graphical user interface, which allows loading as well as analyzing data measured by a Multicollector-Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer, i.e. determining the age of carbonate archives like speleothems and corals.

Created as part of my bachelor's thesis.

## [Fiverr projects](https://fiverr.com/users/zebleck/)

Multiple Unity game development projects that have been programmed as part of gigs purchased on [fiverr](https://fiverr.com/).

## [Entry for Q-Summit Hackathon](https://github.com/zebleck/Hackathon-404-Not-Found)

Machine learning challenge by IBM that was tackled in a team of four during the two day Q-Summit hackathon. The goal was to create a model for assigning teachers to schools (and vice versa), while keeping in mind preferences of both and achieving a "fair" assignment.
