Hello, my name is Fabian, online I go by zebleck. My destiny has brought me to study M.Sc. Data and Computer Science at the University of Heidelberg in Germany. Before that, I did my B.Sc. Physics at the same university.

I love all things having to do with artifical intelligence, artificial life and technology in general and hope those things will be used for the betterment of everyone.

# Projects

## [Exist Founder Scholarship](https://www.exist.de/EXIST/Navigation/DE/Home/home.html)

To found our product *Cosmos*, which aims to offer an afforable and secure energy management and smart home solution, our team Hausable is receiving the EXIST Founder Scholarship. EXIST is a German government program that provides funding and support to individuals and teams interested in starting a business based on their research or technological expertise. It helps founders develop their business ideas and bring them to market through funding, coaching, and mentorship.

## [Samsung Solve for Tomorrow Finalist](https://www.samsung.com/de/sustainability/corporate-citizenship/local-engagement/solve-for-tomorrow/home/)

With our innovative edge-based smart home and energy optimization solutin, our team Hausable qualified to be in the top 5 teams in Samsungs Solve for Tomrorrow challenge (2022), which seeks creative and innovative ideas to empower the protection of our urban environments and to improve the living conditions of their habitants. 


## [Unity implementation of Lenia](https://twitter.com/zebleckAI/status/1496244990929948672)

Lenia is a ruleset for creating continuous cellular automata which produce complex behaviour and even artificial life. I am currently working on an implementation on Unity, which will be distributed on the iOS and Android app stores in the future.

## [Webdeveloper at MaMpf E-Learning platform](https://github.com/MaMpf-HD/mampf)

MaMpf is an open source E-Learning platform for the mathematical sciences, which I am contributing to at the University of Heidelberg. The project uses the programming language Ruby as well as the webframework [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/).

## [Reinforcement Learning of Countermeasures for COVID-19 spread prevention](https://github.com/zebleck/aml_project)

In this project, we used reinforcement-learning to train an agent controlling the government supervising a COVID-19
simulation. We used the DQN algorithm for reinforcement learning to train an agent controlling a hypothetical government to prevent the spread of the COVID-19
infecton.

Done as part of the course *Advanced Machine Learning*.

## [GUI: Th/U-Dating of Speleothems and Corals](https://github.com/zebleck/BachelorGUI)

Graphical user interface, which allows loading as well as analyzing data measured by a Multicollector-Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer, i.e. determining the age of carbonate archives like speleothems and corals.

Created as part of my bachelor's thesis.

## [Fiverr projects](https://fiverr.com/users/zebleck/)

Multiple Unity game development projects that have been programmed as part of gigs purchased on [fiverr](https://fiverr.com/).

## [Entry for Q-Summit Hackathon](https://github.com/zebleck/Hackathon-404-Not-Found)

Machine learning challenge by IBM that was tackled in a team of four during the two day Q-Summit hackathon. The goal was to create a model for assigning teachers to schools (and vice versa), while keeping in mind preferences of both and achieving a "fair" assignment.
